    <div class="content">
      <p>Ahoy there, mateys!<br /><br />It&rsquo;s been three months since our last correspondence. Apologies for the negligence. I&rsquo;ve been busy, as usual, but it&rsquo;s more self-inflicted than usual. I&rsquo;ve taken up a new role at Canonical, working on <a href="http://juju.ubuntu.com/">Juju</a>.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m really excited about Juju (both the concept and realisation), and the fact that it&rsquo;s written in Go is icing on the cake. Working remotely is taking some getting used to, but so far it&rsquo;s been pretty swell. Anyway, you didn&rsquo;t come here to read about that, did you?<br /><br />I&rsquo;m still working on <a href="http://github.com/axw/llgo">llgo</a> in the background, quietly prodding it along towards the <a href="https://github.com/axw/llgo/issues?milestone=1&amp;state=open">0.1 milestone</a>. There&rsquo;s just one big ticket item left, and that&rsquo;s partially done now: channels. I&rsquo;ve just finished porting the basics of channels from gc&rsquo;s standard library to llgo&rsquo;s runtime. That doesn&rsquo;t include select, which is entirely missing. When that&rsquo;s done, I&rsquo;ll be content to release 0.1.<br /><br />So what&rsquo;s new since last time?<br /><br /><ul><li>There&rsquo;s a new llgo-build tool, which takes the pain out of building packages and programs with llgo and the LLVM toolchain. Just run &ldquo;llgo-build &lt;package&gt;&rdquo;, and you&rsquo;ll either build and install a package, or build a program in the working directory. There&rsquo;s no freshness checking, so you&rsquo;re currently required to manually build all dependencies before building a program.</li><li>Simplified building against PNaCl: llgo-dist now accepts a &ldquo;-pepper&rdquo; option, which points to a NaCl SDK.</li><li>Implemented support for map literals.</li><li>Implemented complex number arithmetic.</li><li>Implemented channels (apart from anything select-related)</li><li>Numerous bug fixes.</li></ul><div>In my previous post I talked about having implemented panic/recover, and having implemented them in terms of DWARF exception handling. Well, it looks like PNaCl isn&rsquo;t going to support that, at least initially, so a setjmp/longjmp version is likely inevitable now.</div><div><br /></div><div>I also said I would be working on a temporary for of cmd/go. I gave up on that, after hitting a few stumbling blocks. I figured it was more important to actually get the compiler and runtime working than get bogged down in the tooling, hence the simpler llgo-build tool.</div><div><br /></div><div>That&rsquo;s about it! &ldquo;Feature complete&rdquo; is getting closer, though lots of things still don&rsquo;t work very nicely. Still no garbage collection, no proper escape analysis, etc. Those will come in time.</div><div><br /></div><div>For now, though&hellip; I think I might go catch up on some sleep.</div></p>
