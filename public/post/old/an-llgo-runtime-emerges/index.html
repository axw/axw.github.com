    <h1 class="title">An llgo runtime emerges</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p>It&rsquo;s been a long time coming, but I&rsquo;m now starting to put together pieces of the llgo runtime. Don&rsquo;t expect much any time soon, but I am zeroing in on a design at least.&nbsp;The sleuths in the crowd will find that only string concatenation has been implemented thus far, which is pretty boring. Next up, I hope, will be interface-to-interface conversions, and interface-to-value conversions, both of which require (for a sane implementation) a runtime library.<br /><br />I had previously intended to write the runtime largely in C, as I expected that would be the easiest route. I started down this road writing a basic thread creation routine using pthread, written in C. The code was compiled using <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a>, emitting LLVM IR which could be easily linked with the code generated by llgo. It&rsquo;s more or less the same idea implemented by the gc Go compiler (linking C and Go code, not relying on pthread). Even so, I&rsquo;d like to write the runtime in Go as much as possible.<br /><br />Why write the runtime in Go? Well for one, it will make llgo much more self contained, which will make distribution much easier since there won&rsquo;t be a reliance on Clang. Another reason is based on a lofty, but absolutely necessary goal: that llgo will one day be able to compile itself. If llgo compiles itself, and compiles its own runtime, then we have a great target for compiler optimisations: the compiler itself. In other words, <a href="http://prog21.dadgum.com/136.html">&ldquo;compiler optimisations should pay for themselves.&rdquo;</a><br /><br />In my last post I mentioned that LLVM 3.1 is coming up fast, and this release has the changes required by llgo. Unfortunately, I&rsquo;ve just found that the C API lacks an interface for linking modules, so I&rsquo;m going to have to submit a patch to LLVM again, and the window for inclusion in 3.1 has certainly passed. Rather than break gollvm/llgo&rsquo;s trunk again, I&rsquo;ll create a branch for work on the runtime. I&rsquo;ll post again when I&rsquo;ve submitted a patch to LLVM, assuming the minor addition is accepted.</p>
