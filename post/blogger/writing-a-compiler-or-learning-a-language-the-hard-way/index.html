    <h1 class="title">Writing a Compiler, or Learning a Language the Hard Way</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p>For a while now I&rsquo;ve been lamenting the lack of progress in systems programming languages. I work primarily in C++ (professionally, anyway), a language which leaves a lot to be desired. The end result, assuming you know what you&rsquo;re doing, is likely to be fast code. But getting there can be a tedious and precarious journey. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I&rsquo;m not a C++ hater. I just think we can do better.<br /><br />So for the past few I&rsquo;ve been&nbsp;storing away ideas for writing my own language. (<i>Groan,&nbsp;another one</i>.) The vast majority of languages these days seem to be JVM based, or some other VM such as the CLR. This is fine for many applications, but for a lot of systems programming you typically want to be much closer to the hardware. What I want is something with the ease and rapidity of development of, say, Python, with the power of a lower-level language such as C/C++.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></b><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">The Easy: Ideas</span></b><br /><br />So what are those ideas I&rsquo;d stored away then? Well to be honest, many of them boil down to syntactic sugar (syntactic caramel?), so here are the more functional ones:<br /><br /><ul><li><b>Implicit Interfaces</b>. The idea is that classes should be able to implement an interface without explicitly saying so, just by implementing the methods defined in the interface. Poor-man&rsquo;s duck-typing if you will.</li><li><b>Link Time Optimisation (LTO)</b> should be the norm. Say you write a function in a library which does everything and the kitchen sink. If the calling program only uses a function from your library in a certain way, then the function should be optimised for that usage.</li><li><b>Pure Functions.</b>&nbsp;This kind of fits under LTO. I want simpler meta-programming: it should be possible to mark functions as being &ldquo;pure&rdquo;, which means (in my terminology) that the function either has no side-effects, or affects only temporary variables. Calls to these functions could then be evaluated at compile time, e.g. to calculate complex mathematical expressions. I guess this just comes under &ldquo;fancy optimiser&rdquo;?</li><li><b>Pattern Matching.</b>&nbsp;I haven&rsquo;t really fleshed this one out, but I think it would be handy to be able to match functions not just based on signature, but based on the values of the arguments.</li><li><b>No preprocessor, no headers. </b>When code is distributed, the modules should be self describing, such as with Java&rsquo;s compiled .class files. This would eliminate problems such as compiling against an old version of an interface, and linking against a new, incompatible implementation.</li><li><b>For the love of God, no garbage collection.</b>&nbsp;What can I say? I like my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Acquisition_Is_Initialization">RAII</a>.</li><li>I&rsquo;m not really sure what title to give this one, but I wanted to eliminate the problems you get with linking objects together that have been compiled with different options in C++ (e.g. with/out RTTI, exceptions, or perhaps against an entirely different STL/standard library.)</li></ul>There were some other requirements I had in mind, such as having a single reference implementation&nbsp;Ã &nbsp;la CPython, and including a parser with the runtime to simplify tool development.<br /><div><br /></div><div><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></b></div><div><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">The Hard: Writing a Compiler</span></b></div><div><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></b></div><div>Anyone can come up with ideas. Even coming up with practical ideas isn&rsquo;t too hard, but implementing them is something else altogether. Especially so for someone like me who has had no formal education in compilers, or language design/implementation. Hell, my university course didn&rsquo;t even cover formal grammars or parsing. I&rsquo;ve picked some things up by myself, but it&rsquo;s a very academic field.</div><div><br /></div><div>Back when I was in uni, I toyed around with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cminusminus.org/">C&ndash;</a>, which at the time looked like quite a promising &ldquo;portable assembly language&rdquo;. This language is (or at least was) used as the intermediate language for the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/">Glasgow Haskell Compiler</a>. My self-taught knowledge of language design/implementation and code generation were not really up to scratch, so I didn&rsquo;t get much further than writing toy languages.</div><div><br /></div><div>Fast forward a few years, and I&rsquo;ve got the itch to implement a compiler again. I&rsquo;ve recently been playing around with LLVM. It boasts a relatively easy to use API, which takes out some of the drudgery of writing the &ldquo;bitcode&rdquo; (an intermediate code that can be translated to machine code). I&rsquo;ve got a bit more knowledge and programming skill behind my belt now, so let&rsquo;s get to work on that language, right!?</div><div><br /></div><div>I read something recently which is summarised as: learn intimately that which you wish to replace. Now I don&rsquo;t have any illusions of replacing any existing language, but I think the message is still relevant. I&rsquo;ve never implemented a language OR a compiler before, and now I&rsquo;m going to both at once? How about I make this a bit easier on myself, and write a compiler for an existing language. If I still want to implement my own language later, I can use the experience I gained.</div><div><br /></div><div>I&rsquo;ve been looking for an excuse for a while now to learn the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.golang.org/">Go Programming Language</a>. It has some of the same design goals as my hypothetical language, so it seemed like a good fit.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><b>The Fun: Learning Go and LLVM</b></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><b><br /></b></span></div><div>I&rsquo;ve been learning Go in my precious spare time for the last couple of weeks. There&rsquo;s a nifty web-app which provides an interactive tutorial in Go, called <a href="http://go-tour.appspot.com/">A Tour of Go</a>. It&rsquo;s a bit of fun, and I recommend it to anyone wanting to learn the language.</div><div><br /></div><div>So anyway, I&rsquo;m now playing around with writing a Go compiler using LLVM. Why?</div><div><ul><li>To learn LLVM, and more generally how to write a compiler and generate code.</li><li>To learn Go.</li><li>Potentially to fill a gap in JIT compilation of Go programs.</li><li>Why not?</li></ul><div>Writing the compiler will be made much easier by the fact that the Go runtime includes a Go parser, and someone has already implemented <a href="https://github.com/nsf/gollvm">Go bindings for LLVM</a>. I haven&rsquo;t made a great deal of progress yet, but it seems achievable. When I&rsquo;ve got something vaguely useful, I&rsquo;ll chuck it over on GitHub.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>If you know anything about Go, you&rsquo;ll probably have noticed that at least one of the ideas that I presented above is present in Go: implicit interfaces. I really can&rsquo;t say whether this concept is new or not - it&rsquo;s probably not - but I did at least come up with it independently. Just sayin&rsquo;!</div><div><br /></div><div>I&rsquo;ll write a follow-up post when I get some time, describing a bit more about the Go compiler, the challenges I&rsquo;ve come across, and my thoughts on how to solve them.&nbsp;</div></p>
