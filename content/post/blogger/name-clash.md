Rats, looks like I didn't do enough homework on the name "csnake". Turns out there's another Python-based project called CSnake:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/csnake-org/CSnake/">https://github.com/csnake-org/CSnake/</a>. Incidentally - and not that it matters much - I had the name picked out before that project was released. Now I need to think up another puntastic name.
