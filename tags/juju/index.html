      <h1 class="title"><a href="https://awilkins.id.au/post/juju-2.3-storage/">Coming in Juju 2.3: storage improvements</a></h1>
      <div class="content">
        

<p>I&rsquo;ve just about wrapped up a set of improvements to storage for
<a href="https://jujucharms.com/">Juju</a> 2.3, the next &ldquo;minor&rdquo; release.
If you&rsquo;re already using, or have been planning to use Juju&rsquo;s
storage support, read on.</p>

<h3 id="dynamic-storage-management">Dynamic storage management</h3>

<p>Juju charms can specify storage requirements: the number of
filesystems or block devices its application requires. For
example, the <a href="https://jujucharms.com/postgresql">PostgreSQL</a>
charm requires a filesystem on which to store the database.
If you don&rsquo;t tell Juju otherwise, the storage will go onto
the root filesystem, but you can also tell Juju to provide
the charm with cloud storage (Amazon EBS, OpenStack Cinder,
etc.)</p>

<p>One of the missing pieces that users have been asking for is
the ability to manage the lifecycle of storage independently
of applications and units, and to reuse existing storage. In
Juju 2.3, when you remove an application or unit, the storage
attached to the unit(s) will (if possible) be detached, rather
than destroyed, and will remain in the model. You can then
either remove the storage using <code>juju remove-storage</code>, or
attach it to a new unit using the new <code>juju attach-storage</code>
command, or the <code>--attach-storage</code> flag added to <code>juju deploy</code>
and <code>juju add-unit</code>. To complement <code>juju attach-storage</code>, there
is also a new <code>juju detach-storage</code> command.</p>

<p>So to illustrate, you can now deploy PostgreSQL with cloud
storage, then remove the application, and redeploy (e.g. with
more RAM), using the same storage.</p>

<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%">juju deploy postgresql --storage=10G
…
juju remove-application postgresql
…
juju deploy postgresql --constraints mem=16G --attach-storage pgdata/0
</pre></div>


<p>We&rsquo;re still working on giving you commands to remove storage
from the model without destroying it, and then import it into
a new model (possibly new controller). This is required
for disaster recovery. Whether this makes it for 2.3 depends
on prioritisation; if it doesn&rsquo;t make it for 2.3, it shouldn&rsquo;t
be far behind.</p>

<h3 id="lxd-storage-provider">LXD Storage Provider</h3>

<p>One thing that we hadn&rsquo;t planned for 2.3, but we did manage to
get done, is a LXD storage provider. <a href="https://insights.ubuntu.com/2017/07/12/storage-management-in-lxd-2-15/">LXD has recently added
its own storage management API</a>,
and Juju 2.3 will have a storage provider that uses it. I
originally implemented the Juju side of things as a bit of a
hack, behind a feature flag, in order to speed up the development
of the aforementioned attach/detach changes. The LXD storage
API turned out to be very straight forward to build on, so we
decided to release the Juju changes into the wild in case it&rsquo;s
of use to others. Particularly if you&rsquo;re developing or testing
charms that use storage, this should be useful.</p>

<p>Using the LXD storage provider is as simple as:</p>

<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%">juju deploy postgresql --storage=10G,lxd
</pre></div>


<p>Each storage pool using the &ldquo;lxd&rdquo; storage provider will create
an associated storage in LXD. When you create a storage pool
in Juju, you need to specify two configuration attributes:</p>

<ul>
<li>the LXD storage pool name, as the &ldquo;lxd-pool&rdquo; attribute</li>
<li>the LXD storage driver, as the &ldquo;driver&rdquo; attribute</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also define driver-specific attributes, which will be
passed through to the LXD storage driver verbatim.</p>

<p>Juju predefines a &ldquo;lxd-zfs&rdquo; pool, with the following attributes:</p>

<ul>
<li>lxd-pool=juju-zfs</li>
<li>driver=zfs</li>
<li>zfs.pool_name=juju-zfs</li>
</ul>

<p>If you deploy an application with storage using the lxd-zfs
pool, Juju will create a LXD storage pool called &ldquo;juju-zfs&rdquo;
with the &ldquo;zfs&rdquo; driver, and ZFS pool called &ldquo;juju-zfs&rdquo;. To
find out more about the LXD storage driver options, see the
<a href="https://github.com/lxc/lxd/blob/master/doc/storage.md">LXD storage docs</a>.</p>

      <h1 class="title"><a href="https://awilkins.id.au/post/juju-2.1-lxd-centos/">Juju 2.1 and CentOS</a></h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>In the <a href="https://jujucharms.com/">Juju</a> 2.1 release, I made a couple of small
changes to better support CentOS servers.</p>

<p>The first change was to support &ldquo;manual provisioning&rdquo; of CentOS machines.
Manual provisioning is when you point Juju at a machine, and Juju connects
to the machine over SSH and sets it up with a Juju agent. To do this, Juju
needs to run a small shell script to discover the OS version and hardware
characteristics of the machine. With a minor change to that script, you can
now manually provision CentOS machines.</p>

<p>The second change is to support CentOS LXD images. A small change was needed
in the Juju code to support the &ldquo;centos7&rdquo; OS version, and alter the way we
handle local LXD image aliases. If an image exists locally with the expected
alias (e.g. &ldquo;juju/centos7/amd64&rdquo;), then we&rsquo;ll use that and skip looking in
the remote image sources. This also improves container startup time when
you live in a faraway land like me. Altering Juju is not quite enough though,
as there are no existing CentOS images that Juju can use.</p>

<p>Juju (mostly) requires <a href="https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/">cloud-init</a> to be
present on the machines it starts, so that it can inject Juju-specific configuration
and scripts to run on startup. Unforunately, there are no CentOS LXD images
that have cloud-init already. To work around this, I wrote a standalone Go
program to transform the <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org">linuxcontainers.org</a>
CentOS image: <a href="https://github.com/axw/juju-lxd-centos-image-builder">github.com/axw/juju-lxd-centos-image-builder</a>.
Eventually we hope to have pre-canned CentOS LXD images available to Juju,
but for now you can use this program to prepare an image for Juju. Run it from
the LXD host, and Juju will be able to use the resulting image.</p>

      <h1 class="title"><a href="https://awilkins.id.au/post/juju-2.1-prometheus/">New in Juju 2.1: Prometheus Metrics</a></h1>
      <div class="content">
        

<p><a href="https://jujucharms.com/">Juju</a> is an application modelling tool,
enabling &ldquo;model-driven operations&rdquo;. I won&rsquo;t go into detail about
what Juju is in this blog post, so if you&rsquo;re new to Juju I suggest
clicking on the link and reading a bit more.</p>

<p>Juju is a distributed application, with a &ldquo;controller&rdquo; cluster that
manages cloud resources (machines, networks, volumes, etc.), and
applications that use those resources. The controller cluster is
currently based on top of MongoDB, utilising replica sets for data
replication and leadership election.</p>

<p>As well as the controller cluster, Juju agents run on every virtual
machine that the controller manages. The controllers, and those agents,
each run many fine-grained, but dedicated &ldquo;workers&rdquo;. For example,
each agent runs a worker to detect block devices and publish that
information to the controller cluster; each controller runs a worker
to maintain the replica sets in MongoDB.</p>

<p>Many things can go wrong in a distributed system. Network partitions
can cause system-wide failures. Bad actors (badly written; less often,
malicious) may starve others of resources. Failure to release memory
or file handles leads to exhaustion, causing a DoS. Juju has seen its
fair share of each of these problems.</p>

<p>To combat such issues, we have recently added Prometheus monitoring to
Juju. As of Juju 2.1, Juju controllers and agents will export Prometheus
metrics. There are two ways to get at them:</p>

<ul>
<li>(on controllers) an HTTPS endpoint, https://&hellip;:17070/introspection/metrics.</li>
<li>(on Linux agents) an abstract domain socket, @jujud-machine-&lt;machine-ID&gt;</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/prometheus-juju-metrics.png" alt="Juju metrics available from Prometheus" /></p>

<h2 id="configuring-prometheus-to-scrape-juju-controllers">Configuring Prometheus to scrape Juju controllers</h2>

<p>To configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from Juju controllers, you will
need to add a new scrape target to Prometheus. The metrics endpoint requires
authorisation, so you will need to configure a user and password for
Prometheus to use:</p>

<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%">$ juju add-user prometheus
$ juju change-user-password prometheus
new password: &lt;password&gt;
type new password again: &lt;password&gt;
</pre></div>


<p>For this new &ldquo;prometheus&rdquo; user to be able to access the metrics endpoint,
you must grant the user read access to the controller model:</p>

<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%">$ juju grant prometheus read controller
</pre></div>


<p>This gives the prometheus user just enough permission to read information
on the controller, without allowing it to make changes, which would not
be ideal for a monitoring application.</p>

<p>Juju serves the metrics over HTTPS, currently with no option of degrading
to HTTP. You can configure your Prometheus to skip validation, or you can
store the controller’s CA certificate in a file for Prometheus to verify
the server’s certificate against:</p>

<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%">$ juju controller-config ca-cert &gt; /path/to/juju-ca.crt
</pre></div>


<p>We can now add a scrape target to Prometheus. Modify prometheus.yml, adding
the following scrape target:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">scrape_configs:
  job_name: juju
    metrics_path: /introspection/metrics
    scheme: https
    static_configs:
      targets: ['&lt;controller-address&gt;:17070']
    basic_auth:
      username: user-prometheus
      password: &lt;password&gt;
    tls_config:
      ca_file: /path/to/juju-ca.crt
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/images/prometheus-juju-api-requests-total.png" alt="Juju API requests total metric" /></p>

<h2 id="configuring-prometheus-to-scrape-juju-agents">Configuring Prometheus to scrape Juju agents</h2>

<p>To expose the metrics of agents, you can deploy the <a href="https://jujucharms.com/u/axwalk/juju-introspection">juju-introspection</a>
charm onto that agent&rsquo;s machine. For example, on machine 1, you would
run:</p>

<pre><code>juju deploy ~axwalk/juju-introspection --to 1
</code></pre>

<p>The metrics of that agent can then be obtained via:</p>

<pre><code>http://&lt;machine-1-address&gt;:19090/agents/machine-1/metrics
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this is not an officially supported charm. The code for it is available at:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/axw/juju-introspection-charm">https://github.com/axw/juju-introspection-charm</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/axw/juju-introspection-proxy">https://github.com/axw/juju-introspection-proxy</a></li>
